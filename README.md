The repository Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_CP1 includes the following files:

    'README.txt'

    'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

    'features.txt': List of all features.

    'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

    'X_train.txt': Training set.

    'y_train.txt': Training labels.

    'X_test.txt': Test set.

    'y_test.txt': Test labels.
      
    'run_analysis.R' : Code to be run

    'tidy_data.txt' : The output of run_analysis.R


Run run_analysis.R in R Studio. It does the following: (copied from the problem statement)
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Run the file run_analysis.R. It will create a tidy_data.txt file.
